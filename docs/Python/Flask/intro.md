# Flask - Initial setup
```python
$ mkdir microblog
$ cd microblog
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

**What happens when you run /venv/bin/activate:**

- This command temporarily modifies your shell's environment variables, particularly the PATH variable, so that the shell prioritizes the virtual environment's bin directory over the system-wide directories.
- This ensures that the Python interpreter and any packages you install come from this virtual environment, not from the system-wide Python installation.
- You'll notice the shell prompt changes to indicate the virtual environment is active, typically appearing as (venv).

**Deactivating the virtual environment:**

To exit the virtual environment and return to the system-wide Python environment, simply run:
`deactivate`

**Install flask**

To install Flask within the virtual environment, use:
`(venv) $ pip install flask`
**Setting Up the Application Package**

Let's create a package called app, which will host the Flask application:

`(venv) $ mkdir app`

The `__init__.py`  file in the app package will initialize the Flask application:

```python title="app/__init__.py -  Flask application instance"
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
from app import routes
```
Now, let's define the routes for the application:
```python title="app/routes.py - the Home page route"
from app import app

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
**Understanding the @app.route Decorators**

The @app.route lines above the index function are decoratorsâ€”a powerful feature of the Python language. 

Decorators allow you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. 

In Flask, they are commonly used to register a function as a callback for a specific URL.

- The @app.route('/') decorator associates the root URL (/) with the index function.
- The second @app.route('/index') decorator associates the /index URL with the same function.

This means that when a browser requests either / or /index, Flask invokes the index function and 
sends the return value ("Hello, World!") as a response.

**Main Application Module**

Next, create the main module that will run the application:

```python title="microblog.py: Main application module"
from app import app
```
```python title="the project structure so far:"

microblog/
  venv/
  app/
    __init__.py
    routes.py
  microblog.py
```
**Running the Application**

Flask needs to know how to import the application, which is specified by 
setting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

`(venv) $ export FLASK_APP=microblog.py`

`(venv) $ flask run --port 5001`

**Persistent Environment Variables with .flaskenv**

Since environment variables aren't preserved across terminal sessions, setting FLASK_APP each time can be tedious. 
To automate this, install the python-dotenv package:

`(venv) $ pip install python-dotenv`

Create a .flaskenv file in the project's root directory to store the environment variable:

`# .flaskenv: Environment variables for Flask command
FLASK_APP=microblog.py
`

Now, when you run flask run, Flask will automatically read the .flaskenv file and apply the environment variables, simplifying your workflow.
