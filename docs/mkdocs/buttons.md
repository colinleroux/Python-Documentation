# Buttons

## Usage
Adding buttons

In order to render a link as a button, suffix it with curly braces and add the .md-button class selector to it. The button will receive the selected primary color and accent color if active.

Adding primary buttons

If you want to display a filled, primary button (like on the landing page of Material for MkDocs), add both, the .md-button and .md-button--primary CSS class selectors.

Adding icon buttons

Of course, icons can be added to all types of buttons by using the icon syntax together with any valid icon shortcode, which can be easily found with a few keystrokes through our icon search.
